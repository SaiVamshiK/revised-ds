Given a linked list consisting of L nodes and given a number N. The task is to find the Nth node from the end of the linked list.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 2
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9
Output: 8
Explanation: In the first example, there
are 9 nodes in linked list and we need
to find 2nd node from end. 2nd node
from end os 8.  
Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
LinkedList: 10->5->100->5
Output: -1
Explanation: In the second example, there
are 4 nodes in the linked list and we
need to find 5th from the end. Since 'n'
is more than the number of nodes in the
linked list, the output is -1.


/* struct Node {
  int data;
  struct Node *next;
  Node(int x) {
    data = x;
    next = NULL;
  }
};
*/

//Function to find the data of nth node from the end of a linked list.
int getNthFromLast(Node *head, int k)
{
    int n=0;
    Node *cur=head;
    while(cur)
    {
        n++;
        cur=cur->next;
    }
    n=n-k;
    if(n<0)
    {
        return -1;
    }
    cur=head;
    while(n--)
    {
        cur=cur->next;
    }
    return cur->data;
}
